# PMDX-Matryoshka-Edition
A romhack for Project Mirai DX

This romhack is basically one huge community-created hack.

It includes things like custom songs, textures, charts, and more!

The way it works is simple; fork this project and make your additions. I will test them personally to make sure it all works, and if so, I'll merge the request. Just make sure there are no conflicts with existing modifications and you're good to go.

# Installing the pack
This is the easiest part of it all. Simply place all the contents of the repo on your SD card, open up GodMode9, and use the Install script for your region. This requires the [latest version of GodMode9.](https://github.com/d0k3/GodMode9/releases)
