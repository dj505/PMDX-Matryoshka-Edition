# PMDX-Matryoshka-Edition
A romhack for Project Mirai DX

**THIS *SHOULD* WORK WITH THE JPN VERSION OF THE GAME, HOWEVER THERE WILL LIKELY BE ISSUES.**

This romhack is basically one huge community-created hack.

It includes things like custom songs, textures, charts, and more!

The way it works is simple; fork this project and make your additions. I will test them personally to make sure it all works, and if so, I'll merge the request. Just make sure there are no conflicts with existing modifications and you're good to go.

# Installing the pack
This is the easiest part of it all. Simply place all the contents of the repo on your SD card, open up GodMode9, and use the Install script for your region. This requires the [latest version of GodMode9.](https://github.com/d0k3/GodMode9/releases)

NOTICE: This romhack requires a Nintendo 3DS that has custom firmware such as Luma3DS installed. If you do not have custom firmware, you will be unable to use this hack. Custom firmware is completely safe to install as takes about 20 minutes maximum. Follow [3ds.guide](http://3ds.guide) for a full tutorial on how to get custom firmware up and running. If you're on system version 11.4.0 or above, you cannot install CFW without a hardmod or a system transfer from a hacked console.

# Current modifications
There are already a number of modification from the time I've spent working on this in my own time. These include:

- Restoring the animated PV vidoes from Mirai 2
- Replacing the default button icons with Playstation icons (to remove, delete the "spr_ae_button.bin" from the aet_en folder)
- Replaced the opening video and music
- Replaced 1/6 -out of the gravity- with Two Faced Lovers
- Changed Len and gumi's color schemes to match the Matryohska PV for Lon/Soraru's cover
- Started working on Setsuna Trip
- Started working on an Extra Hard mode for Senbonzakura
- Matryoshka has been replaced with Lon/Soraru's cover of the song
- 1 2 Fanclub has been replaced with Lon/Soraru's cover of the song
- No Logic now has a SuperHard/Expert chart (full credit to Mirai-san on GBATemp)
