# PMDX-Matryoshka-Edition
A romhack for Project Mirai DX

This romhack is basically one huge community-created hack.

It includes things like custom songs, textures, charts, and more!

The way it works is simple; fork this project and make your additions. I will test them personally to make sure it all works, and if so, I'll merge the request. Just make sure there are no conflicts with existing modifications and you're good to go.

# Installing the pack
This is the easiest part of it all. Simply place all the contents of the repo on your SD card, open up GodMode9, and use the Install script for your region. This requires the [latest version of GodMode9.](https://github.com/d0k3/GodMode9/releases)

# Current modifications
There are already a number of modification from the time I've spent working on this in my own time. These include:

- Restoring the animated PV vidoes from Mirai 2
- Replacing the default button icons with Playstation icons (to remove, delete the "spr_ae_button.bin" from the aet_en folder)
- Replaced the opening video and music
- Replaced 1/6 -out of the gravity- with Two Faced Lovers
- Changed Len and gumi's color schemes to match the Matryohska PV for Lon/Soraru's cover
- Started working on Setsuna Trip
- Started working on an Extra Hard mode for Senbonzakura
- Matryoshka has been replaced with Lon/Soraru's cover of the song
- 1 2 Fanclub has been replaced with Lon/Soraru's cover of the song
